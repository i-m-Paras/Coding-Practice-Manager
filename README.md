# Coding-Practice-Manager
This is a website I made to keep record of my solved questions while I practice DSA or CP

"/add":
this will redirect you to a page where you can add 1) the link to the question you solved
                                                   2) some comment for that question
                                                   3) image of your solution or some quick logic
                                                   4) drop down menu to select topic of the question
                                              
this redirects to "/home": 
here you can see the list of questions you added , if you click on the question you will be redirected to the question and you can see the solution/hint to solution you uploaded for that question.


Made for management and quick revision
